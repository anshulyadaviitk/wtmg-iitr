  bio: 'Dr. Anshul Yadav is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Water Resources Development & Management at IIT Roorkee and the founding Principal Investigator of the Water Treatment & Monitoring Group (WTMG). His research unites advanced separation science with smart sensing, spanning membrane distillation, electrodialysis, adsorption, and the design of polymeric, composite, and MOF/ZIF-based membranes. By coupling these materials with IoT-enabled water-quality sensor networks, he pursues real-time, data-driven solutions for drinking-water security and industrial wastewater reuse. His work has led to multiple patents—peer-reviewed publications, and competitive funding from national agencies. Beyond the lab, Dr. Yadav integrates research, teaching, and outreach.  ',
